        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

          <p>
            <span data-descr="Commonly known as CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</span>
            is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of a
            webpage. If HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, then CSS is the
            meat on the bones. Whereas HTML strictly pertains to webpage
            markup, CSS deals with colors, aesthetics, and visual layout. It
            hooks onto specific elements of an HTML page and formats them
            using any number of style options.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, jumping into CSS isn't always straightforward. As it
            often goes in web development, formatting visual styles on a
            website requires an explicit level of detail and a precise command
            of the language. Remember that creating web applications isn't a
            drag-and-drop process; colors, aesthetics, fonts, and visual
            layouts all need to be coded in order for every browser to
            consistently render the page correctly.

        <h2>How CSS Works</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            CSS code references specific HTML elements and then applies
            changes to how they're formatted. The format options are called
            properties in CSS, and they can be modified in various specific
            ways. Don't expect to memorize all of the formatting options
            available through CSS. For many of your early weeks and months as
            a developer, you'll need to continually reference
            <span data-descr="For example, W3Schools or MDN Web Docs">websites</span>
            to find the exact syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Believe it or not, you can build complex web layouts through
            simple HTML and CSS alone!
