            Hi! My name is Michaela Wells. I am currently working for Rocket Mortgage as a Condominium Underwriter. I have been working for Rocket Mortgage for almost 2 years now, September will mark 2 years with the company. I am super thankful for working for Rocket as they are the reason I heard about this Coding Bootcamp from Michigan State University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in south eastern Michigan in Manchester, Michigan. Just before high school started we moved to Saline where I enrolled in the local high school studying art, painting and photography being my favorite. After high school i moved to Grand Rapids to go to college where I graduated with a Business Degree for Marketing and Supply Chain management. Post college I stayed in the west Michigan area for a number of months until I some friends reached out and let me know that one of their roommates moved out and offered me the open spot out in sunny California so I took the leap, packed my car and drove across the country. Fast forward to the end of 2021 and I did that cross country drive again and now live in the city of Louisville, Kentucky with my cousin.

            <h3>Git Lab Repository</h3>
            The Git Lab Repository link takes you directly to my personal repository. Upon clicking the link your screen changes over to an overview off all the repositories I have created to see all the current and past projects I've worked on.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Challenge 1 - Horiseon</h3>
            Challenge 1 was the first homework assignment we turned in for this course. For this assignemnt we were given an already built out code and were asked to modify it with the focus of <strong>accessibility.</strong> The company Horiseon "hired" us to rework their website to make it more accessible as this is an increasingly important thing for businesses to keep in mind for their webpages. We are given a user story that explains the overall goal of our assignment and then acceptance criteria that are our guidelines of what we need to adjust and update in the code to successfully complete the assignment. For this particular assignment the acceptance criteria was to make sure the code follows a logical strucure, correct semantics were used, and alt text was used appropriately for the photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Challenge 2 - Portfolio Build</h3>
            Challenge 2 is the second homework assignment that we are currently working on that is building our own portfolio. For this assignment we were to build all the code ourselves, none was provided for us. We were given a user story that explained what was being asked of us, a deployed portfolio of work samples set up in an easily accessible way for future employers to review but show the work we are capable of to decide if we are a good fit for the company. The acceptance criteria for this assignemnt was that there was a name, recent photo and links to the authors work as well as a contact form. Additionally we were to set up the page so that when you click on a link in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section, a section that shows the author's work, active links that take you to the deployed website for that body of work, images in the code and a responsive layout that adapts to a viewport.
