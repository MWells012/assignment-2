            Hi! My name is Michaela Wells. I am currently working for Rocket Mortgage as a Condominium Underwriter. I have been working for Rocket Mortgage for almost 2 years now, September will mark 2 years with the company. I am super thankful for working for Rocket as they are the reason I heard about this Coding Bootcamp from Michigan State University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in south eastern Michigan in Manchester, Michigan. Just before high school started we moved to Saline where I enrolled in the local high school studying art, painting and photography being my favorite. After high school i moved to Grand Rapids to go to college where I graduated with a Business Degree for Marketing and Supply Chain management. Post college I stayed in the west Michigan area for a number of months until I some friends reached out and let me know that one of their roommates moved out and offered me the open spot out in sunny California so I took the leap, packed my car and drove across the country. Fast forward to the end of 2021 and I did that cross country drive again and now live in the city of Louisville, Kentucky with my cousin.
