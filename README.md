# The Portfolio of a Developing Coder

This was the second homework assignment of the course. In this activity we are building our own portfolio from the blank page up. It needs to be a deployed portfolio of work samples set up in an easily accessible way for future employers to review but show the work we are capable of to decide if we are a good fit for the company. The goal is to have this portfolio start at the beginning of the course so that throughout the duration of the course we are able to update the formatting as well as content stored with all the projects we work on creating a well rounded porfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

The completed applciation should meet the following criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

#### Usage

There is a great benefit in having a portfolio from the very beginning of this journey into the world of coding, it allows me to show the true improvements and progress in the work from the start to end of the course. It's like keeping an online journal of your artwork essentially.

This portfolio is also setting us up for sucess as we can use it to show people our work while away from the computer or on the fly. So few people want physical copies (not like you can provide a physical copy of a website) of things to review when they're talking jobs because it doesn't show the company what you're really capable of. Having a portfolio built that has in-line links and all the magic tricks shows that you not only take the time to make sure you have quality work to show and display your skills but that you take this seriously and are ready to present your work at the drop of a dime.

##### Learnings

The goal of this assignment was to learn how to write code from the ground up and how to use our resources. I purchased a very basic book on HTML and CSS to see another formatting of the knowledge I am slowly gaining with this fast paced course. The book on a number of occasions did help me understand better what I was looking to do and where to begin my search as google was my main resource and aid with this build.

More websites were used than I can count but it taught me that there are many ways you can do the same thing, it all just depends on what you're trying to accomplish and hot it fits in with what you've already written. In attempts to create anchors in my code I visited 9 websites alone before I found one that had content that was directly applicable to what I was building. Not only was using google a huge help but inspecting websites as well. I did my gradient header via pulling the code from the built website by inspecting the code beacuse I liked the color scheme at first. I ended up changing it but I pulled the code from the inspecting side of the page because it was exactly what I needed, 2 weeks ago that idea wouldn't have even slightly crossed my mind to do to learn new information.

Additionally I learned that this a creative process and just have fun with it. I re-wrote my site at least 5 or 6 times in the span of an hour because I just was not satisfied and that was okay as long as I wasn't pushing the deadline back. Additionally I learned that adding color and doing different things also makes the assignment feel less obligatory and more fun, that the learning and execution of all this is going to be helpful and beneficial for me in the long run.
